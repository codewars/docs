Users earn new privileges as their Honor grows. These can be divided in a couple of groups:

- Authoring activities: a user is able to create new kata or translations.
- Beta process: a user can vote on ranking and satisfaction of beta kata. Votes of more privileged users have more power than the others.
- Content curation: a user can approve kata and translations after reviewing them, or edit kata to fix issues.
- Moderation: a user is able to mark comments as spoilers, unmark them, or mark issues as resolved.

Privileges are earned by reaching a certain level of Honor. The exact required amounts to gain some privilege is listed in [this table][privileges-reference].
