# What is a Kata?
On Codewars, kata are code challenges focused on improving skill and technique. Some train programming fundamentals, while others focus on complex problem solving. Others are puzzles meant to test your creative problem solving, while others are based on real world coding scenarios.

The term was first coined by [Dave Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Thomas_%28programmer%29), co-author of the book [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer) as an acknowledgment to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts. Dave's version of the concept defines a code kata as an exercise in programming which helps a programmer sharpen their skills through practice and repetition.

## Repetition
On Codewars the idea of repetition is encouraged at your own pace. You will not be pressured to repeat kata you have already completed. If you struggle on a kata it is recommended that you save it to a [[collection|collections]] and revisit the kata later. Even doing a kata just once will often give you some of the value that would normally only come from repetition. This is because after you complete a kata, and your solution is fresh within your mind, you are shown the solutions of other warriors. This can often lead to an epiphany that you otherwise would have to have found on your own over time. 

## Practice and Repeat Training
On the Codewars dashboard you will always find a kata that you can train with. These kata are chosen at random based on a training routine. If you select "Practice and Repeat" routine then you will only be given kata you have already trained on. This is an excellent way to hone your skills. Repeatedly completing the same kata will allow you to discover and master efficient ways of handling common programming tasks.

You can learn more about training routines [[here|training-routines]].

## How Are Kata Created?

Each kata is crafted for and by the community. Kata are created by other users rewarded with kata authoring privilege. When a kata is published by an author (or Sensei), it will go into a [[beta process|kata-beta-process]] where the community can help test and provide quality assurance feedback. The author who created kata will initially include one or more languages to train in. Other users later can "translate" the kata into additional languages.
