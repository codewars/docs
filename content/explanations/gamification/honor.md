# Honor

Honor represents the level of respect a user has earned from the community, based on their skill and contributions. While ranks are an indication of your skill only, honor is mostly an indication of your activity and contributions.

## Honor rewards

You earn honor when you accomplish certain goals on Codewars:

- Completing a kata rewards you with some amount of Honor depending on the rank of solved kata,
- Reaching a higher rank grants you additional Honor in amount related to reached rank,
- Authoring activities, like publishing a beta kata, creatign a translation, or having your kata approved,
- Community activities, for example voting on kata satisfaction, rating a beta kata, upvotes and downvotes collected on your posts and solutions

You can find exact amount of rewarded Honor points in [this reference](/references/gamification/honor/).

Your profile page displays a breakdown of your Honor points:

## Leaderboards and Honor Percentile

You can determine the level of your achievements in comparison with overall Codewars community in two ways:

- **Leaderboards**: Codewars manages [leaderboards (TODO: link to leaderboards reference)]() which show users with highest amount of Honor.
- **Honor Percentile**: Stat which shows your position relative to all Codewars users. Percentile of, for example, 20%, means that 20% of all Codewars users have more Honor points than you, and that you have more Honor points than 80% of all other users.
