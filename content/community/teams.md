# Teams and Organization

## Administrators

Administrators are people who created, maintain, and are responsible for Codewars overall. They handle the most critical issues, like:
- Development and maintenance of Codewars platform,
- Fixing platform bugs related to Codewars functions, user interface, code runner,
- Managing user accounts,
- Handling severe cases of violations of rules.

Cuttently, active users with status of Administrator are:

- [kazk](https://www.codewars.com/users/kazk)

They can be recognized by symbol of a crown (üëë) displayed by their user name.

## Moderators

Moderators are small team of users selected by Administrators to support them in handling some tasks related to community and Codewars content. Moderators have tools and privileges which help with maintenance of content and with handling of some community issues. Moderators have access to tools which allow them to:
- Moderate discourses,
- Manage submitted solutions: re-test them, flag as cheats, etc.
- Identify cheaters, plagiarists, and users who do not play the game fair,
- Handle abusers and revoke their privileges,
- Maintain documentation.

Moderators also serve as intermediaries (word?) between Codewars users and Administrators, or vice versa. They can pass anouncements from maintainers, or support users in communication when some issue needs to be brought to attention of Administrators.

But still, Moderators are just regular users, and as such, they're subject to all Codewars rules. In particular, they **cannot**:
- Fix problems with kata they have no privileges to coauthor,
- Approve translations which cannot be normally approved,
- Modify kata in a way which is not directly supported by Codewars: change its ranking, move it back to beta, retire or delete it.

 Moderators need to stick to [Codewars Code of Conduct](/community/rules/), they can use the site as every other user, and they are obliged to play the game fair. When they misbehave, violate rules, or abuse their privileges, their moderator status may be revoked.

Currently, users with status of Moderator are:

- [Blind4Basics](https://www.codewars.com/users/Blind4Basics)
- [Chrono79](https://www.codewars.com/users/Chrono79)
- [donaldsebleung](https://www.codewars.com/users/donaldsebleung)
- [g964](https://www.codewars.com/users/g964)
- [hobovsky](https://www.codewars.com/users/hobovsky)
- [monadius](https://www.codewars.com/users/monadius)
- [steffan153](https://www.codewars.com/users/steffan153)
- [Unnamed](https://www.codewars.com/users/Unnamed)

They can be recognized by symbol of a shield (üõ°Ô∏è) displayed by their user name.

## How to get in touch

All kinds of issues are to be reported to [Codewars Github board](https://github.com/codewars/codewars.com/issues), using appropriate issue template if available. There are already issues dedicated to handling [spammers](https://github.com/codewars/codewars.com/issues/1493) and [cheaters](https://github.com/codewars/codewars.com/issues/1378).

Issues which should not be exposed public or should be brought directly to attention of Administrators should be reported via email to <info@codewars.com>.

Many members of moderation team (but not all of them) can be reached via [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Codewars/codewars.com). Message them directly or post on one of the public channels if you need their assistance.
