## Moderators

Our moderators are an amazing group of passionate and dedicated users who have earned the trust and respect of our admins through their years of hard work and contributions. They are responsible for supervising user activities and have access to powerful [moderation tools](/community/moderation/tools/) and extra privileges. We are so grateful to work with them!

Example responsibilities include:

- Moderating discussions (on the platform and Discord) 
- Managing submitted solutions (re-testing, flagging as cheats, etc.)
- First responders to cheaters, plagiarists, and users who do not play the game fairly
- Handling tier-one abuse reports 
- Providing additional, specialised support
- Accepting and rejecting changes to the documentation
- Serving as intermediaries between users and admins

Moderators, like all other community members, must stick to the [Codewars Code of Conduct](/community/code-of-conduct/), they can use the site as every other user and are obliged to play the game fair. Their moderator status may be revoked if they misbehave, violate rules, or abuse their privileges.
