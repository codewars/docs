# Moderation

Codewars is very much community based, and it heavily relies on its users to provide the site with the content, keep its quality high, and help other users. To keep such a large and complex place as Codewars in order, and make community and content management easier, two teams of users with access to some additional tools and privileges were created: Administrators, and Moderators. Their task is to support users working with the platform, monitor for potential issues, and react, handling the issues appropriately.  


## Administrators

Administrators are people who maintain Codewars, and who are responsible for its overall shape. They handle the most critical issues, like:
- Development and maintenance of the Codewars platform,
- Fixing platform bugs related to Codewars functions, user interface, code runner,
- Managing user accounts,
- Handling severe cases of violations of rules.

Currently, active users with Administrator status are:

- [kazk](https://www.codewars.com/users/kazk)

They can be recognized by the symbol of a crown (üëë) displayed next to their username.

## Moderators

Moderators are a small team of users selected by Administrators to support them in handling some tasks related to the community and Codewars content. Moderators have tools and privileges which help with maintenance of content and with handling of some community issues. Moderators have access to tools which allow them to:
- Moderate discourses,
- Manage submitted solutions: re-test them, flag as cheats, etc.
- Identify cheaters, plagiarists, and users who do not play the game fair,
- Handle abusers and revoke their privileges,
- Accept or reject changes to documentation submitted by users.

Moderators also serve as intermediaries between Codewars users and Administrators, or vice versa. They can pass announcements from maintainers, or support users in communication when some issue needs to be brought to the attention of Administrators.

Moderators need to stick to the [Codewars Code of Conduct](/community/rules/), they can use the site as every other user, and they are obliged to play the game fair. When they misbehave, violate rules, or abuse their privileges, their moderator status may be revoked.

Currently, users with Moderator status are:

- [Blind4Basics](https://www.codewars.com/users/Blind4Basics)
- [Chrono79](https://www.codewars.com/users/Chrono79)
- [donaldsebleung](https://www.codewars.com/users/donaldsebleung)
- [g964](https://www.codewars.com/users/g964)
- [hobovsky](https://www.codewars.com/users/hobovsky)
- [monadius](https://www.codewars.com/users/monadius)
- [steffan153](https://www.codewars.com/users/steffan153)
- [Unnamed](https://www.codewars.com/users/Unnamed)

They can be recognized by the symbol of a shield (üõ°Ô∏è) displayed next to their username.

## How to get in touch

All kinds of issues are to be reported to the [Codewars Github board](https://github.com/codewars/codewars.com/issues) using an appropriate issue template if available. There are already issues dedicated to handling [spammers](https://github.com/codewars/codewars.com/issues/1493) and [cheaters](https://github.com/codewars/codewars.com/issues/1378).

Issues which should not be exposed publicly or should be brought directly to the attention of Administrators should be reported via email to <info@codewars.com>. For security issues, please read our [security policy](https://github.com/codewars/codewars.com/security/policy).

Many members of the moderation team (but not all of them) can be reached via [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Codewars/codewars.com). Message them directly or post on one of the public channels if you need their assistance.
