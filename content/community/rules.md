# Community Code of Conduct

The purpose of our Community Code of Conduct is to ensure that all participants in the Codewars community have the best possible experience. We are all here to help each other learn, grow our skillsets and have a good time!

The Codewars Community Code of Conduct covers our behavior as members of the Codewars community, in any forum, mailing list, wiki, web site, code repository, IRC channel, private correspondence, or public meetings.

As a worldwide community, diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to, to ensure that the Codewars community continues to be an excellent space in which to communicate, collaborate, and contribute.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended — a guide to make it easier to be excellent to each other. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

## Rules

**Be considerate.** Codewars may have "war" in the name but it is actually a respectful and polite community. You will be interacting with users from across the globe, who have different personal opinions and come from different backgrounds and cultures. We are all here for the same thing, to learn and improve. The Codewars community has developers of all skill levels actively participating on the site and in discussions. If you are an experienced programmer, remember that others may not be. We are all learning, we just may be at different stages in that process.

**Be patient.** This mostly applies to forums, mailing lists, and code contributions (i.e. asynchronous forms of communication). It is possible that your question or code contribution or suggestion might not receive an immediate response. Be patient and consider the norms of the community. One reminder ping is welcome, many reminder pings in rapid succession are not a good display of patience. Similarly, posting the same question in multiple threads is frowned upon and should not be done.

**Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We expect members of the Codewars community to be respectful when communicating with other community members, as well as with people outside the community.
Be nice. Everyone in the Codewars community should feel welcome, regardless of their background. Please be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members. No offensive comments will be tolerated.

**Communicate effectively.** We don't all speak the same language at the same skill level. Clear communication can help to avoid misunderstandings, as can remembering that our interpretations of words can be different depending on our backgrounds. Having context is important. It's better to ask for clarification than to make assumptions. Disagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we expect participants in the project to resolve disagreements constructively — so please avoid flamewars, trolling, personal attacks, and repetitive arguments. 

**Be honorable.** Cheating is discouraged. If you find a way to complete a kata that falls outside of the kata itself (notably but not limited to: exploiting Codewars's test framework, website and servers), then refrain from doing so. Violators will be banned for such usage. Codewars has algorithms to detect some forms of cheating but does not attempt to track down every possible way. If you witness someone else who has a solution that you do not feel to be honorable, please report it on the [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/Codewars/codewars.com) or on [this issue](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/issues/1378).
**Please do not post your solutions on Github**. We realize you would like to use these challenges as your resume, but you should have side-projects for that. If a Code Warrior is unable to find a solution online, then they are further encouraged to complete the task themselves - which will enable them to get more value out of their time spent. 

## Policy

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, intelligence, professional experience, or contributed content. Any form of deliberate intimidation and stalking will also be considered harassment. 

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If any content is found with inappropriate content it will be taken down. 

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the community admins may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or banning the offender from the site.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please bring it to our attention by emailing us at info@codewars.com.

If you are caught cheating on a challenge, you will initially have your solution marked as a cheat and will not receive any honor or rank. This includes clever solutions that are clearly created for the spirit of cheating. Repeat offenders who have intentionally cheated will be banned.
