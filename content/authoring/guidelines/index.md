# Codewars Content Quality Guidelines

## Overview

_This page is a stub._

This set of pages contains guidelines for kata authors and translators to create good descriptions for their kata. They were collected to help ensure that kata and translations are of sufficient quality and user experience will be as good as possible.

The guidelines should be used by kata authors, translators and reviewers to verify whether new content about to be introduced to Codewars is of sufficient quality. Conformance with them should be verified before a kata or translation is published by its author and approved by a reviewer.

:::warning Important note
Failure to comply with the guidelines should be considered an issue to be addressed and reported as such. In case of severe violations, the affected kata or translation may be retired, moved back to beta or rejected.
:::

:::note
Some of these guidelines do not apply to every type of content. Use where applicable, do not use where not. But don't be lazy.

- Quality
  - do your best, stick to guidelines specific to the type of created content (kata, translation, snippets, ...)
