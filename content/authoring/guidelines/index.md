# Codewars Content Quality Guidelines

## Overview

This set of pages contains guidelines for kata authors and translators to help them create kata, translations and kumite which adhere to the community's quality standards.

The guidelines should be used by kata authors, translators and reviewers to verify whether new content about to be introduced to Codewars is of sufficient quality. Conformity to these guidelines is a prerequisite for publishing a kata, translation or kumite.

All Codewars content is created by the community and for the community. The community is the only mechanism for enforcing and elevating quality standards. All Codewars users are encouraged to provide suggestions for improving content and reporting or fixing issues.

Since the guidelines were introduced after many kata had been created, older kata may fail to meet the standard of quality. In such cases, beta kata and pending translations should be updated to improve their quality as much as possible before approval. Existing kata, on the other hand, can be approached in a more relaxed way. Obvious bugs and severe issues should be fixed, but otherwise, guidelines can be applied gradually as the kata receives new translations, or as issues are raised and fixed.

Some of these guidelines do not apply to every type of content. There are code golf kata, puzzle kata, hackmes, debugging kata, and many other problems which are designed on the grounds of ignoring some of the guidelines. They should be used where applicable, and can be skipped when they are not. But this should not be treated as an excuse for taking shortcuts or skipping the necessary work: the fact that some of the guidelines are not relevant should be clearly visible from the task.

:::warning Important note
Failure to comply with the guidelines should be considered an issue to be addressed and reported. In case of severe violations, the affected kata or translation may be retired, moved back to beta or rejected.

Authors and reviewers who repeatedly violate or ignore rules and introduce poor-quality content to the system can have their authoring or approval privileges revoked and offending content withdrawn.

## General Guidelines

- **Conform to quality guidelines when creating new content.** Do not take shortcuts, don't be lazy. Know what are quality requirements for kata, translations, descriptions, and code. Do not push your responsibility to reviewers.
- **When reviewing, verify conformance of the content with the quality guidelines.** Do not count on authors to get everything right.
- **Keep responsibility for all content you approved or created.** You should actively maintain all content you introduced into Codewars: fix issues, consider suggestions, answer questions.
- Whenever possible, **improve any content of insufficient quality** by fixing bugs and identifying and addressing usability issues. Leave every kata you visit in better shape than you found it. Conversely, this means other users are allowed to improve your content.
- Remember that you can always **ask others for help.** Whenever you need someone to proofread your description, answer any questions about how Codewars works, or just give any advice on the content you're working on.
