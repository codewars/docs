# Writing a Reference Solution

:::note
On this page, the term "Reference Solution" refers to a separate code snippet provided by a kata author or translator, which is used by Codewars to verify the correctness of the kata while it's being published.

For guidelines related to the piece of code used by submissions tests to generate expected answers, see [Reference Solution][authoring-guidelines-tests-solution] section on [Writing Submission Tests][authoring-guidelines-tests] page.
:::

The reference solution **should conform to [General Coding Guidelines][authoring-guidelines-general-coding]** because it must be maintained, unlike other submitted solutions. Always think about the future maintainers and translators.
