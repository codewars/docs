_TBD: improve this stub_

New translators may refer to the [tutorial(TODO)](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Tutorial:-How-to-translate-a-kata).

Some [languages](/languages/) also have a page dedicated to authoring kata, with code examples and best practices.

Every translator should follow [translation authoring guidelines](/authoring/guidelines/translation/).

After being published, every translation goes through a series of [reviews](/curation/translation/) before it can be approved.

<!--
TODO: this page would relate to creating both initial language version, as well as new translation

## Remarks on translating

- stick to guidelines

### Shared Descriptions

Please note, the description is shared among all kata languages. Do not add or remove anything specific to your language unless absolutely necessary. In that case use [sequenced code blocks][sequential-code-blocks] and [optional section formatting][conditional-rendering] - add a new block using the formatter for your language and it will be displayed only when that particular language is selected in the kata overview, solutions page, discourse, and trainer.

## How to announce your translation

When you publish your translation the original kata sensei will be automatically notified that your effort is pending their approval. But it is also good practice to write a comment in the kata "Discourse" to announce what you have done. This way, if the original author has been absent from Codewars for a prolonged period of time, another qualified user can review and approve in their place.

Tip: marking that comment as a `suggestion` will also help your translation from being accidentally overlooked.
