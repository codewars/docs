# Kata

_TBD: improve this stub_

## Requirements

To create a new kata, a user needs to earn the ["Create Kata" privilege][reference-privileges]. After reaching the required amount of Honor, the privilege is granted and the user can select the **"New Kata"** option from their profile menu.


## Kata Editor

Kata are created with the [kata editor](/references/ui/kata-editor/)

Users new to creating kata may refer to the [tutorial(TODO)](/authoring/kata/).

Some [languages](/languages/) also have a page dedicated to authoring kata, with code examples and best practices.

Every kata author should follow [kata authoring guidelines](/authoring/guidelines/kata/).

After being published, every kata goes through the [beta process](/concepts/kata/beta-process/) and is subject to a series of [reviews](/curating/kata/).
