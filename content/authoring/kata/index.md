## Creating a Kata

_TBD: improve this stub_

Users new to creating kata can use [tutorial(TODO)](/authoring/kata/).

Some [languages](/languages/) also have a page dedicated to creating a kata, with code examples and best practices.

Every kata author should follow [kata authoring guidelines](/authoring/guidelines/kata/).

After being published, every kata goes through the [beta process](/concepts/kata/beta-process/) and is subject to a series of [reviews](/curating/kata/).
