# Criteria for Kata Approval and Retirement

## Eligibility for Approval

As an author gets more katas approved, they become established as an experienced kata maker, and less votes will be needed for their future kata to be approved. The following table lists the requirements for a beta kata to be able to be approved:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Level</th>
<th>Required satisfaction %</th>
<th colspan="4">Required amount of votes (by # of author's approved kata)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
<th>&lt;10</th>
<th>&lt;20</th>
<th>&lt;30</th>
<th>30+</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>White</td>
<td>80+</td>
<td>12</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yellow</td>
<td>80+</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Blue</td>
<td>75+</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Purple</td>
<td>70+</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Auto-Retire

Low quality kata are automatically retired. Current rules are:

1. If 4 or more votes and satisfaction percent is `0` (4+ consecutive "Not Satisfied" as the only votes)
2. If kata collected enough votes to be approved or more (see table above), and satisfaction percent is less than or equal to the half of the required satisfaction.

This feature needs improvement and any feedback is appreciated. Please comment on [#1672](https://github.com/codewars/codewars.com/issues/1672).
