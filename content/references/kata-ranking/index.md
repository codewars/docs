## White (Beginner)

### 8 Kyu

8 kyu kata represent a beginner level.
At this level, the kata are only challenging for users new to programming.
This includes programming tasks such as:

- Defining a simple function (i.e. hello world)
- Basic variable assignments
- Fixing basic syntax issues
- Trivial algorithms such as basic if/else statements

### 7 Kyu

7 kyu kata represent a beginner programming level.
At this level, the kata will generally challenge users on their core language and API reference knowledge.
Tasks such as:

- Iterating arrays and returning a subset of values
- Basic data type manipulations
- Basic functional or object-oriented concepts
- Basic Regular Expressions

## Yellow (Novice)

### 6 Kyu

6 kyu kata represent a novice programming level. At this level, the kata will start to include more advanced algorithmic challenges and more complex language features. It includes:

- Complex language features (closures, scopes, monads, etc)
- Complex OOP/Functional concepts
- Basic Design Patterns
- Complex Regular Expressions

### 5 Kyu

5 kyu kata represent a novice programming level.
At this level, the kata are similar to 6 kyu but more challenging.
It includes:

- Complex language features that require mature OOP/Functional concepts
- Advanced OOP/Functional concepts
- Complex Design Patterns
- Advanced regular expression usage

## Blue (Competent)

### 4 Kyu

4 kyu kata represent a competent programming level.
At this level, the kata begin to take some serious thought to complete.
They include tasks that may handle:

- Computer science concepts utilizing complex algorithms
- Advanced design patterns
- Understanding intricate business requirements
- Advanced concepts such as concurrency, parallelism, meta programming and cryptography

### 3 Kyu

3 kyu kata represent a competent programming level.
At this level, the kata are similar to 4 kyu but are more challenging.
They include tasks that may handle:

- Computer science concepts utilizing advanced algorithms
- Ability to implement advanced requirements in a scalable fashion
- Basic AI/machine learning algorithms
- Detailed usage of advanced concepts such as concurrency, parallelism and cryptography

## Purple (Proficient)

### 2 Kyu

2 kyu kata represent a proficient programming level.
At this level, kata require a mature understanding of complex programming concepts - concepts such as:

- Complex AI/machine learning algorithms
- Reverse engineering techniques
- Basic interpreters and compilers
- Basic mini-programs with multiple feature requirements (such as a basic Markdown parser)

### 1 Kyu

1 kyu kata represent a proficient programming level.
At this level, kata are similar to 2 kyu but more challenging.
They may include concepts such as:

- Advanced AI/machine learning algorithms
- Complex interpreters and compilers
- Complex Mini-programs with multiple feature requirements (such as a complete Markdown parser)
