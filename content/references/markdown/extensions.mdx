Codewars adds a few Markdown extensions for writing kata descriptions.

## Sequential Code Blocks

Used to display [code blocks](/references/markdown/#code-block) only in the language selected by the user.

### Details

- Each code block must have an info string set to a valid language ID. To find the language ID, visit its documentation from the [languages page](/languages/).
- The order of the code blocks/languages doesn't matter.
- To avoid rendering errors/problems:
  - Always put an empty line before and after the complete group of code blocks
  - Never put empty lines between individual code blocks of the same sequential group.

### Example

````markdown
```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

```typescript
const add = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
```

```ruby
def add(a, b)
  a + b
end
```
````

If the active language of the user is TypeScript, the above Markdown is rendered to the following:

> ```typescript
> const add = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
> ```

## Conditional Rendering

Conditional rendering blocks renders the content when the language selected by the user matches the condition specified in the info string.

### Basic syntax

````markdown
```if:java
For java, use `Preloaded.check(input)`.
```
````

If the selected language is java, this block is showing up in the description, rendered to:

> For java, use `Preloaded.check(input)`.

### Details

- The language name in the info string has to match a valid language ID. To find the language ID, visit its documentation from the [languages page](/languages/).
- To obtain proper rendering, language-specific blocks need an empty line before and after them, just like code blocks.
- You can use Markdown inside conditional blocks, but [be careful when inserting code blocks](/references/markdown/extensions/#using-code-blocks-inside-conditional-blocks).
- You can use different kinds of conditions or assigned them to groups of languages using the following syntaxes:
  - `if:language`
  - `if:language,language2`
  - `if-not:language`
  - `if-not:language1,language2`

### Examples

#### `if:languages`

````markdown
```if:javascript,typescript
Shown _if_ the active language is JavaScript **or** TypeScript.
```

```if:ruby
Shown _if_ the active language is Ruby.
```
````

If the active language is Ruby, the above renders:

> Shown _if_ the active language is Ruby.

#### `if-not:languages`

````markdown
```if-not:javascript,typescript
Hidden _if_ the active language is JavaScript **or** TypeScript.
```

```if-not:ruby
Hidden _if_ the active language is Ruby.
```
````

If the active language is Ruby, the above renders:

> Hidden _if_ the active language is JavaScript **or** TypeScript.

### Using Code Blocks Inside Conditional Blocks

To use code blocks within these conditional blocks, use tildes (`~`) to declare the conditional block or increase the number of backticks used.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
````markdown
~~~if:javascript
Used tilde to open conditional block.
```javascript
// Regular code block
```
~~~
````

`````markdown
````if:javascript
Used 4 backticks
```javascript
// Regular code block
```
````
`````

## Math Typesetting

Math typesetting is supported with the following two syntaxes:

- Inline: [code span](/references/markdown/#code-span) starting and ending with `$`
- Block: [code block](/references/markdown/#code-block) with info string `math`

See the [support table](https://katex.org/docs/support_table.html) on [KaTeX](https://katex.org) to find all of the supported syntaxes.

### Commonly used Symbols/Functions

| Symbol/Function | Represents            |
| :-------------- | :-------------------- |
| `x_n`           | indice                |
| `x^n`           | exponant              |
| `\lt`           | lower than            |
| `\leq`          | lower or equal        |
| `\lgt`          | greater than          |
| `\geq`          | greater or equal      |
| `\sum`          | sigma (sum)           |
| `\prod`         | pi (big)              |
| `\pi`           | pi (small)            |
| `\to`           | arrow                 |
| `\lim`          | limit                 |
| `\infty`        | infinite              |
| `{ ... }`       | to group instructions |

### Example

````markdown
Suppose `$ x_n \leq l \leq y_n $` and `$ \lim_{n\to\infty} (x_n - y_n) = 0 $`,
prove that `$ \lim_{n\to\infty} x_n = \lim_{n\to\infty} y_n = l $`.

```math
x_n \leq l \leq y_n
```

```math
\lim_{n\to\infty} (x_n - y_n) = 0
```

```math
\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n = \lim_{n\to\infty} y_n = l
```
