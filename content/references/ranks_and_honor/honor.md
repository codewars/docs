# Honor

Honor represents the level of respect a user has earned from the community, based on their skill and contributions. While ranks are an indication of your skill only, honor is mostly an indication of your activity and contributions.

You earn honor when you accomplish certain goals on Codewars.

## Leaderboards and Honor Percentile

You can determine the level of your achievements in comparison with overall Codewars community in two ways:

- **Leaderboards**: Codewars manages [leaderboards (TODO: link to leaderboards reference)]() which show users with highest amount of Honor.
- **Honor Percentile**: Stat which shows your position relative to all Codewars users. Percentile of, for example, 20%, means that 20% of all Codewars users have more Honor points than you, and that you have more Honor points than 80% of all other users.
