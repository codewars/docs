## Remarks on accepting a translation

Before you accept a translation, make sure that the difficulty and quality of the translation matches the current languages. In doubt, write a comment on the translation. If the translation diverges from the original kata, ask the translator politely whether they can modify the translation so that it matches the original intent.

If you want to comment on the translation, you can do that on the "Discourse" page, just as in normal katas or kumites. This is especially helpful if you're not sure whether the translation really reflects your original intentions.
