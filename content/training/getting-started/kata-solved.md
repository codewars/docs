# When a Kata is Solved

Finally, this great moment happened: the test output panel is all green, and you were able to submit your solution. Congratulations! It's time to collect your reward. It's also a good time to share some feedback, to guide others who'd encounter the same kata.

## Rewards

You worked hard to solve your last challenge, and after you succeeded, you definitely deserve a reward. Each solved tasks rewards you in two ways: progressing your rank, and granting some amount of Honor points. The more difficult kata you solve, the bigger the reward.

### Rank

The rank level reflects your experience and knowledge you have gained by solving kata. You start at the lowest rank of 8 kyÅ«, and each correct solution brings you closer to a higher rank. You can see your rank progress toward the next level on your profile page:

</div>

More information on ranks and progress can be found [here (TODO: add link to docs on progress)]().

### Honor

Honor points are rewarded by contributing to Codewars in many ways, and solving a kata is one of them. By earning Honor points you gain additional [privileges (TODO: link to docs)]() and climb [leaderboards (TODO: link to docs)]().

## Feedback

After you have successfully solved a task, you can let others know how you liked it. One way to do this is to leave your satisfaction vote:

You can also participate in the discussion on a kata. If you wish to log an issue about this specific kata, such as poorly worded descriptions or issues with test cases, then you can leave a comment in the discourse section. More on this in the next part.
