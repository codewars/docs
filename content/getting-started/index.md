# Introduction

Welcome to Codewars!

Codewars is a platform which helps you learn, train, and improve your coding skills by solving programming tasks of many types and difficulty levels. You can choose how you would like to learn: do you want to face challenges of increasing difficulty? Or maybe you prefer training by repetition and improving your solutions? After solving a task, you can compare your answer with other users and learn from them too, or you can help less experienced users and answer their questions.
