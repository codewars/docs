You decided to join Codewars? That's great! There are a few steps to create your new account and start solving tasks, learning, and improving your skills!

## First step

First, go to the [Sign Up](https://www.codewars.com/join) page. You will be presented with a board featuring many languages:

![languages board](./img/registering_01_choose_language.png)

Choose a language that you like, want to learn, or are familiar with. It will be used to present your first challenge.

## Your first challenge

This is an entry-level task that you must solve to prove your dedication and commitment to learning. Let's see.

The task states: "The code does not execute properly. Try to figure out why." Let's take a closer look. Of course! A tiny detail is missing that is causing a compilation error! Put it in the correct place, fix the code, and click `SUBMIT`. The server will process the solution and soon you will receive the test report. Don't worry if you made a mistake and your answer is incorrect! Click `TRY AGAIN` and fix your solution.

If your answer is correct, you will experience the best thing in the life of a coder _[citation needed]_: **green tests**! Congratulations!
