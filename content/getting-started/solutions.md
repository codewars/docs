# Viewing Solutions


Viewing accepted solutions, be it after solving a kata or after unlocking them, is one of the best ways to learn. Other users could have different ideas for solving the task. Their solutions can be clearer, shorter, faster, or use functions you did not know existed. You can learn a lot while studying them, and it's very often worthwhile to at least briefly read them over.

If some solution caught your attention in particular, or you want to praise it, criticize in some way, or if you have some questions about it, you can write a post in solution's discourse section.
