# Solving Kata

After clicking on a link to a kata, you are presented a [kata details (TODO: link to kata details panel doc)]() view with general information about it. Read carefully through the description, and if you are ready to face the challenge, click `TRAIN`. 

## Kata Trainer

Welcome to the kata trainer! You use this view to take your attempts on solution, write the code and run tests. A few tips to get you started:

### Solution editor

You use solution editor to write code which solves the task. You can type the code straight into the editor, but if you want, you can use your favorite IDE and just copy your solution from it and paste it here. 

### Test

This button will test your solution against the _sample_ tests. Most kata will have provided you some sample tests to get you going, while others will not, in which case some test documentation will be shown instead.

Codewars promotes approach of [Test Driven Development (is link to Wikipedia article OK?)](). This means that you are encouraged to write not only code for your solution, but also add as many tests in `Sample Tests` panel as you can think of (see [Writing Tests]() to see how), for various scenarios, inputs, and edge cases. Everytime you run them by clicking `TEST`, system will execute all sample tests against your solution, and tell you if it passed all of them, or maybe failed some.

When sample tests pass and you believe your solution is ready, you can go to next step.

### Attempt

This button will submit your code against the full set of tests needed to complete the kata. 

You cannot see full tests until you solve the kata. They can fail, even if all sample tests pass.

### Production Quality Code

Some Codewarriors like to write code golfed or creative/clever solutions, but most try to write production quality code. After you have completed all of the test cases (via the attempt button), you will be given an opportunity to cleanup your code so that it's "code review" ready.
