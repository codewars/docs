# Community

Codewars gathers thousands of users of many skills and levels of experience. Their knowledge is invaluable resource and when used correctly, your training can be easier, and extremely effective.

## Kata Discourse

If you want to discuss some particular kata, you can use its discourse page to do so. It's a good place to ask for explanation, search for help with solution, add your opinion on it, or report problems. You can label your post with one of possible labels:

- **Question** - if description is not clear, you need help, got stuck, or you cannot get your solution to work,
- **Suggestion** - if you have an idea how author could change the kata, its description, or tests, to make it better,
- **Issue** - if you think the kata is broken, and author needs to fix it in some way.

Discourse posts support [Markdown formatting (TODO: link to Markdown reference)](), so you can use some styling, or make sure the code is neatly presented with [code formatting blocks (TODO: direct link to Markdown docs, chapter on code blocks)]().

You should also also mark your posts with **Spoiler** flag if it contains some code (even not fully working one), or reveals some significant details of the solution.
