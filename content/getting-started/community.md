# Community

Codewars gathers users with many different skills and levels of experience. Their knowledge is an invaluable resource and they can make your training easier, and extremely effective.

## Kata Discourse

If you want to discuss some particular kata, you can use its discourse page to do so.

It's a good place to ask for explanations, search for help about solution, add your opinion on it, or report problems. You can label your post with one of possible labels when appropriate:

- **Question** - if description is not clear, you need help, got stuck, or you cannot get your solution to work,
- **Suggestion** - if you have an idea how author could change the kata, its description, or tests, to make it better,
- **Issue** - if you think the kata is broken, and author needs to fix it in some way.

See this [detailed documentation (TODO: direct link to Labels reference? same link than the one at the end of the "Communication" part)]() about the different kinds of labels and their use.

Discourse posts support [Markdown formatting (TODO: link to Markdown reference)](), so you can use some styling, or present your code neatly with [code formatting blocks (TODO: direct link to chapter on code blocks in Markdown docs)]().

You should also mark your posts with **Spoiler** flag if they contain some code (even not fully working one), or reveal some significant details of the solution.

## Communication

Remember that your posts will be read by other people, and to be able to help you or answer your questions, they have to be able to understand you properly. Do all you can to express yourself clearly, describe your point with all necessary details, use appropriate labels and code formatting when needed.

There's a set of rules you should follow to keep interaction with other users a good experience for both sides. You can find them in _(TODO: where? Code of Conduct, some discourse guidelines?)_.
