title: After Solving a Kata
---

import ThemedImage from "@theme/ThemedImage";

Finally, this great moment happened: the test output panel is all green, and you were able to submit your solution. Congratulations! It's time to collect your reward. It's also a good time to share some feedback, to guide others who'd encounter the same kata.

## Rewards

You worked hard to solve your last challenge, and after you succeeded, you definitely deserve a reward. Each solved tasks rewards you in two ways: progressing your rank, and granting some amount of Honor points. The more difficult kata you solve, the bigger the reward.

### Rank

The rank level reflects your experience and knowledge you have gained by solving kata. You start at the lowest rank of 8 kyÅ«, and each correct solution brings you closer to a higher rank. You can see your rank progress toward the next level on your profile page:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Rank Progress"
  sources={{
    light: require("./img/solving_01_rank-progress_light.png").default,
    dark: require("./img/solving_01_rank-progress_dark.png").default,
  }}
/>

More information on ranks and progress can be found [here](/gamification/ranks/).

### Honor

Honor points are rewarded by contributing to Codewars in many ways, and solving a kata is one of them. By earning Honor points you gain additional [privileges](/gamification/privileges/) and climb `[leaderboards (TODO: link to docs)]`.

## Feedback

After you have successfully solved a task, you can let others know how you liked it. One way to do this is to leave your satisfaction vote:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Satisfaction Vote"
  sources={{
    light: require("./img/solving_02_vote_light.png").default,
    dark: require("./img/solving_02_vote_dark.png").default,
  }}
/>

You can also participate in the discussion on a kata. If you wish to log an issue about this specific kata, such as poorly worded descriptions or issues with test cases, then you can leave a comment in the discourse section. More on this in the next part.
