## White (Beginner)

### 8 Kyu

8 kyu kata are for coders at the beginning of their programming journey. 
At this level, tasks should only be challenging for users new to coding. 
For example:
- Defining a function, such as [hello world](https://www.codewars.com/kata/523b4ff7adca849afe000035) or [alternating case](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56efc695740d30f963000557).
- Basic variable handling, including skills like [type conversion](https://www.codewars.com/kata/544675c6f971f7399a000e79), [string manipulation](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56bc28ad5bdaeb48760009b0), and [array analysis](https://www.codewars.com/kata/563e320cee5dddcf77000158/).
- Fixing [basic syntax issues](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55cb854deb36f11f130000e1).
- Trivial language features, such as [basic if/else statements](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53369039d7ab3ac506000467).

### 7 Kyu

7 kyu kata are tasks for programmers with more experience than total beginners but are still relatively new to computer science.  
The kata on this level should generaly test the user's knowledge of the core language and API.

Some notable 7 kyu kata categories include:
- Iterating over [arrays](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53d32bea2f2a21f666000256), [numbers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5300901726d12b80e8000498),or [strings](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54ff3102c1bad923760001f3) to return a specified [quantity](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57a1d5ef7cb1f3db590002af) or [subset](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53dbd5315a3c69eed20002dd).  
- [Algorithms](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56a6ce697c05fb4667000029) that aren't performance-intensive.
- Basic [logical](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5cb9dc6f98b230001cbe2cea), [functional](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5413759479ba273f8100003d), or [object-oriented](https://www.codewars.com/kata/513f887e484edf3eb3000001) concepts. <!-- I felt like I should include some of the proof-languages in here -->
- [Basic Regular Expressions](https://www.codewars.com/kata/6361bdb5d41160000ee6db86).<!--shameless self promotion :-)-->

## Yellow (Intermediate)

### 6 Kyu

6 kyu kata represents the start of more complex problems and solutions.  At this level, the kata will start to include more advanced algorithmic challenges and more complicated language features. Some examples of these include:

- [Competent use of Regular Expressions](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5e4eb72bb95d28002dbbecde).

### 5 Kyu

5 kyu kata is when tasks start to challenge the programmers' logical reasoning through an increased level of difficulty and skill requirements.
At this level, a trainee is expected to have a general grasp of the language they are coding in. 5 kyu kata include tasks requiring:

- Using several [complex language concepts](https://www.codewars.com/kata/62fa7b95eb6d08fa9468b384) to achieve a goal.
- Advanced [OOP](https://www.codewars.com/kata/515bb423de843ea99400000a) concepts.

- [Advanced string manipulation](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54a91a4883a7de5d7800009c) and a strong knowledge of [Regular Expressions](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52e1476c8147a7547a000811).

## Blue (Advanced) <!-- I felt that "competent" was a tad bit harsh; That would imply anybody less then 4 kyu arn't capable or statisfactory -->

### 4 Kyu

4 kyu kata represent experienced programming levels.
At this level, the kata begins to take some serious thought to complete.
They include tasks that may handle:

- Complex algorithms that require both [speed](https://www.codewars.com/kata/621f89cc94d4e3001bb99ef4) and [efficency](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5254ca2719453dcc0b00027d).
