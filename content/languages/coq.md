### Versions

- 8.12

### Test Frameworks

[coq_codewars](https://github.com/Codewars/coq_codewars)

### Interactive Proof Editing Support

Unfortunately, the Codewars environment does not support the interactive development of Coq proofs. The current recommended method of solving a Kata is by copying the relevant code snippets onto your local machine and developing your solution locally: preloaded code should go into `Preloaded.v`, your solution into `Solution.v` and the Sample/Submit tests into `SolutionTest.v`.
