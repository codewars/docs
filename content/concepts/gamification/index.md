# Rewards and Progress

On Codewars, there are two different scales you can level up by doing different things:

- [**_Rank_**](/concepts/gamification/ranks/): This scale defines your proficiency and current kyu/dan level. You can level up your rank doing only one thing: solving kata.
- [**_Honor_**](/concepts/gamification/honor/): Honor points represent how active the user is. Honor can be earned in many ways: completing kata, translating them, voting, and many others. Earning Honor points grants you additional [privileges](/concepts/gamification/privileges/), which let you perfom actions not available to everyone, like creating new kata, translations, etc. More details in the next pages.

Your current rank and honor are displayed in the top bar:
