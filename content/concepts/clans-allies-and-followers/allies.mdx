When two users follow each other, they become allies. All your allies are collected in dedicated leaderboards, displayed on your dashboard, or on `Social` tab of your profile. When viewing these boards, you will see all of your allies and be able to keep track of their honor and overall rank progression.

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: require("./img/allies-board_light.png").default,
    dark: require("./img/allies-board_dark.png").default,
  }}
/>

You automatically become allies with members of the same [clan](/concepts/clans-allies-and-followers/clans/), and with users who join Codewars using your referral code.
