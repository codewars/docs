 # Clans

 When you join a clan, you automatically become allies with anyone in that clan. This is a quick way to quickly build up your allies list so that your colleagues and friends can easily keep track of each other's progression and view their solutions. 

Joining a clan is as simple as setting the clan name in your profile. If you want to switch clans, you simply need to change the name. However if you change your clan, you will have to manually unfollow everyone from the previous clan.
