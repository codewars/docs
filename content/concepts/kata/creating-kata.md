# Creating new kata

## How Are Kata Created?

Each kata is crafted for and by the community. Kata are created by other users rewarded with kata authoring privilege. When a kata is published by an author (or Sensei), it will go into a [beta process](/concepts/kata/beta-process/) where the community can help test and provide quality assurance feedback. The author who created kata will initially include one or more languages to train in. Other users later can "translate" the kata into additional languages.
