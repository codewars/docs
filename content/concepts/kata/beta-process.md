# Kata Beta Process

Each kata is crafted for and by the community. Kata are created by other users rewarded with kata authoring privilege. When a kata is published by an author (or Sensei), it will go into a beta process where the community can help test and provide quality assurance feedback and cast a vote for its difficulty ranking. The feedback during this process is vital to making sure all kata are of the highest quality.

Not every user is able to perform a full review of a beta kata, but every user can help in some way! Users are strongly encouraged to participate in the beta evaluation of kata awaiting their approval. For more details, see [Curating of a Kata][curating-kata].
