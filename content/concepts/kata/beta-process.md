# Kata Beta Process

Each kata is crafted for and by the community. Kata are created by other users rewarded with kata authoring privilege. When a kata is published by an author (or Sensei), it will go into beta process where the community can help test and provide quality assurance feedback and cast a vote for its difficulty ranking. The feedback during this process is vital to making sure all kata are of the highest quality.

## Reward for Reviewers

You earn an _additional_ +2 honor for every Beta Kata you solve, in order to reward you for taking the risk of solving a Kata with potential issues. Then, leaving a satisfaction vote and rank assessment on said Beta Kata rewards you with +1 _extra_ honor _each_, in order to reward you for taking the time to leave valuable feedback on said Kata. Finally, if the Kata is approved, you will also receive the honor and rank progress for official Kata. Therefore, it is in everyone's interest that you leave your satisfaction vote and rank assessment on every Beta Kata you have completed.

## Steps of Beta Process

Every member of Codewars community can contribute to beta process of every kata in some way and help evaluating its quality before it's accepted and made available for everyone. Some steps are available only after earnig some privilege, but every user can help reviewing a kata in some way.

### Attempting the Kata

Training on a kata and solving it is the first step to verify its quality, but also a very effective one. Reading through description, users can check if it's clear enough, or something needs to be reworded or explained in a clearer way. When tests are run, reviewers can verify if they are sufficient, or whether assertion messages are clear and easy to understand.

When kata is successfully solved, user unlocks further steps of the review process.

### Satisfaction vote

Users with [sufficient privileges](/references/gamification/privileges/#privileges) are able to vote on kata quality. They can cast one of three possible votes:

- **Satisfied**
- **Somewhat satisfied**
- **Not satisfied**

### Difficulty rating

Similarly, while a kata sensei can mark an estimated rank, each rank vote will help adjust its difficulty.

### Reviewing Code

### Reviewing Issues, Suggestions and Questions

## Kata Approval and Retirement

After a kata has received enough approval votes from the community, fixed any issues, and reached a consensus on it's ranking, it's ready for the final step to come out of beta. At this point, sufficinetly privileged user can review it to make sure all these criteria has been met (see [How to Review a Beta Kata](/recipes/review-beta/)), and release it as an official kata onto the site!
