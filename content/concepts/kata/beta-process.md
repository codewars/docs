# Kata Beta Process 

Each kata is crafted for and by the community. Kata are created by other users rewarded with kata authoring privilege. When a kata is published by an author (or Sensei), it will go into beta process where the community can help test and provide quality assurance feedback and cast a vote for its difficulty ranking. The feedback during this process is vital to making sure all kata are of the highest quality.

## Reward for Reviewers

You earn an _additional_ +2 honor for every Beta Kata you solve, in order to reward you for taking the risk of solving a Kata with potential issues. Then, leaving a satisfaction vote and rank assessment on said Beta Kata rewards you with +1 _extra_ honor _each_, in order to reward you for taking the time to leave valuable feedback on said Kata. Finally, if the Kata is approved, you will also receive the honor and rank progress for official Kata. Therefore, it is in everyone's interest that you leave your satisfaction vote and rank assessment on every Beta Kata you have completed.

## Steps of Beta Process

Every member of Codewars community can contribute to beta process of every kata in some way and help evaluating its quality before it's accepted and made available for everyone. Some steps are available only after earnig some privilege, but every user can help reviewing a kata in some way.

### Attempting the Kata

Training on a kata and solving it is the first step to verify its quality, but also a very effective one. Reading through description, users can check if it's clear enough, or something needs to be reworded or explained in a clearer way. When tests are run, reviewers can verify if they are sufficient, or whether assertion messages are clear and easy to understand. When any issues are found, users can raise issues or sugest changes in kata discourse.

When kata is successfully solved, user unlocks further steps of the review process.

### Satisfaction vote

Users with [sufficient privileges](/references/gamification/privileges/#privileges) are able to vote on kata quality. They can cast one of three possible votes:

- **Satisfied**
- **Somewhat satisfied**
- **Not satisfied**

Your vote should reflect your opinion on the idea behind the kata, and not quality of its description, or code. If you think that idea is nice, but author needs to fix code or description, post appropriate suggestions or issues in kata discourse.

### Difficulty rating vote

Kata author assigns initial difficulty rank estimation to their kata, but they do not decide on its final rank. Difficulty rank is estimated from votes cast by users who solved the kata while it's in beta phase. This means that every user who solved a beta kata can give their own opinion on its difficulty, helping in determining its final rank.

### Reviewing Code

Users with sufficient priviledges can enter kata editor and view the code of all code snippets. Reading through them is a great way to find potential issues with tests, examples, or reference solution. Any discovered problems can be fixed righ away in the code, or reviewer can raise issues or suggest improvements in kata discourse.

### Reviewing Issues, Suggestions and Questions

Some beta kata, especially ones created long time ago, can have some issues or suggestions which are still pending, but have been already fixed or are not applicable anymore because kata has changed. It's very helpful when such old issues are reviewed and marked as resolved if they are not valid anymore. It can also happen that there are posts in the kata discourse which report some problem, but are not labelled appropriately. It's generally a good idea to re-raise such issues as new posts with correct label, as it should help other users to find them and eventually fix them.

## Kata Approval and Retirement

After a kata has received enough approval votes from the community, all issues are fixed, and community reached a consensus on it's ranking, it's ready for the final step to come out of beta. At this point, sufficinetly privileged user can review it to make sure all these criteria has been met (see [How to Review a Beta Kata](/recipes/review-beta/)), and release it as an official kata onto the site!
