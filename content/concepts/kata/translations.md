# Translations

_TBD: this page was imported from old CW wiki and needs to be reviewied/redacted._

Kata authors must write test cases for each specific language that they want to support, as well as a working solution to prove the kata can be solved. As you can imagine, it's not practical for a kata author to be able to write the challenge in all 20+ languages that Codewars supports.

This is where translations come in. They allow other warriors to make katas available in other languages. Any user can publish a translation, where the kata author, an admin, or a power user with the Co-Author privilege can then approve the changes. Once a translation is approved, it will be added to the kata.

## How to Find Them

Once you have completed a kata, there will be a new choice within the languages menu to add a new language.

This will take you to the translations page where you can view existing translations and create new ones.

## Honor & Rank

Translations are worth twice the honor you would normally receive for completing the kata.

Once approved you will also receive the rank progression associated with the translation language. If the kata is in beta, you will receive the rank progression once it gets approved and its rank assigned. After you have contributed to an approved kata, you will not receive the rank progression in any additional languages you translate the kata into.

## Forks

Code Warriors can fork a translation to improve it and help it get approved faster. However they will not receive rank or honor progression, only the original translator will.

## Merge Issues

Oftentimes if two translations are created around the same time, they may both update the description. When approving the 2nd translation, the 1st approved translation will have already updated the description. This will cause a merge conflict which will need to be resolved. You can do this by forking the 2nd translation and updating the description. `<<<<<<<<`, `=========` and `>>>>>>>>` merge labels will show up in the description to help identify where the merge issues are.

Once you have fixed the description merge issues you can publish the translation. If you are not the author then you will need to have someone else verify your changes and approve the translation.
