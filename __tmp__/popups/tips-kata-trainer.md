Welcome to the kata trainer! A few tips to get you started:

## Attempt

This button will submit your code against the full set of tests needed to complete the kata.

## Test

This button will test your solution against the _sample_ tests. Most kata will have provided you some sample tests to get you going, while others will not, in which case some test documentation will be shown instead.

If you care about using TDD, then the sample tests section will be very useful for you. You are encouraged to write your own tests as you try to complete the kata, as you would if you were writing production code.

## Production Quality Code

Some Codewarriors like to write code golfed or creative/clever solutions, but most try to write production quality code. After you have completed all of the test cases (via the attempt button), you will be given an opportunity to cleanup your code so that it's "code review" ready.
