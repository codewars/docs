You just completed a "beta" kata. These are kata that are in the process of being vetted by the community.

A few things you should know about beta kata:

- The community votes on how difficult they think the kata is (Kyu level).
- The community votes on how satisfying the kata is, a kata must have a high rating to make it out of beta.
- The community can leave and discuss issues with the kata on the discourse page. A kata cannot come out of beta if it has issues.
- Once a kata has received enough feedback, other Codewarriors who have earned the privilege to do so (through honor) can approve the kata.
- Once a kata becomes ranked, you will receive the rank credit towards your progress.
- Everyone who completes a beta kata earns an additional honor point for doing so.
