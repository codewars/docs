Kata translations are a great way of gaining honor, plus you are contributing to the overall community! A few things to remember:

### Description - Language Examples

You may need to edit the description to provide info for the new language you are translating. This description field is **shared across all languages**.

If the kata has language examples within the description, **DO NOT REPLACE THESE**. Instead you should add examples for the language you are translating directly underneath the other examples. When taking the kata, the other languages will be filtered out automatically.

**Do not forget to add language examples!**. This is important. Your translation cannot be approved without them. If the kata description is so generic that no specific language examples are included, then you do not need to add any.

### Example Test Cases

Please try to include example test cases, even if they were not included in some of the existing languages. For some rare kata they may not make sense but usually other Codewarriors will appreciate the kata much more if there are example test cases provided for them.

### Translations must be approved

Once you publish your translation either a moderator or the kata author will approve it. A notification will be sent out, but sometimes translators like to leave a comment on the kata as well just so everyone knows.

## Description Tips:

In the kata description you will sometimes need to provide language specific examples. You can use three backticks (fences) to do so. i.e:

````
```javascript
function example(){
}
```
````

If the kata already has languages examples, do not delete them. Instead append your language example to the bottom of the existing ones, like so:

````
```javascript
function example(){
}
```
```ruby
def example
end
```
````
