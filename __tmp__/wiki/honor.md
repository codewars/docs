# Honor

Honor represents the level of respect a user has earned from the community, based on their skill and contributions. While [ranks][ranks] are an indication of your skill only, honor is an indication mostly of your activity and contributions.

This is the amount of points you can see in the top right corner of the page, when you're connected to Codewars.

You gain honor points for a lot of things (completing katas, translating them, voting, from votes your comments or solutions earned, positive votes received on the katas you authored, ... See details below).

## Honor Points

You earn honor when you accomplish certain goals on Codewars.
