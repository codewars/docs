Sometimes, a user will create a translation of your kata. Most users notify you with a comment. So where can you find those translations? Let's have a look at the language dropdown:

Notice the little `+ Add New` at the bottom? Click on it to see the current list of translations:

Here you get a quick overview of all translations. To see them in detail and approve, decline or fork them, click on the translation's title, in this case, "Reverse every other word in the string" PHP translation.

Now, in order to *approve* or *decline* the translation, a click on the correct buttons (top on the right-hand side) is sufficient.

## Remarks on accepting a translation

Before you accept a translation, make sure that the difficulty and quality of the translation matches the current languages. In doubt, write a comment on the translation. If the translation diverges from the original kata, ask the translator politely whether (s)he can modify the translation so that it matches your intent.

If you want to comment on the translation, you can do that on the "Discourse" page, just as in normal katas or Kumites. This is especially helpful if you're not sure whether the translation really reflects your original intentions.
