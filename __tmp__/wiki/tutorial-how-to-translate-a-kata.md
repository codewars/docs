>**Writing a translation**
>
>Now you found a kata in JavaScript. You liked it, and want to translate it into Python. There should be a "+" sign next to the language icons after you solved it. Click on it and you'll land on the list of current translations. After you've checked that there isn't a pending translation in Python, you click on "Translate this kata".
>
>This will open translation kumite editor. Choose the language in the drop-down menu before you write any code. Then fill the (initial) solution and (example) tests. Save your progress often to prevent data loss. Whenever you're ready, publish your translation.

## Step-By-Step Photo Tutorial

When you **finished** a kata, you can translate it to other languages.

>You may check **whether the author is still active or not** at first.
>An author of the kata is most likely to *approve* or *decline* the translation. However any high level Code Warrior on the site who has completed the kata and has 4000+ honor will be able to approve translation, so if the author is not around you may want to add a comment letting other users know there is a translation that can be approved. Only the author will get a notification email about the translation.
