You can associate yourself with other Codewars users in 3 different ways. 

## Following

You can follow any warrior. There are two reasons why you would want to follow someone. 

#### Allies
If you follow someone and they follow you back, you become allies. More on that later. 

#### Solutions 

When viewing the solutions of a kata, you can choose to only see those from users you are following. This is a great way to easily find solutions from warriors you respect or know personally.

## Allies

When two people follow each other, they become allies. When viewing your dashboard you will see all of your allies and be able to keep track of their honor and overall rank progression.

When another warrior joins Codewars using your referral code, you will automatically become allies.

## Clans

When you join a clan, you automatically become allies with anyone in that clan. This is a quick way to quickly build up your allies list so that your colleagues and friends can easily keep track of each other's progression and view their solutions. 

Joining a clan is as simple as setting the clan name in your profile. If you want to switch clans, you simply need to change the name. However if you change your clan, you will have to manually unfollow everyone from the previous clan.
